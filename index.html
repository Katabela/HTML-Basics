          I rarely have time for hobbies BUT my passions lie in art, design, and
          music. I've chosen the Web and UX design pathway to tie my love for
          design and technology together. One unique aspect of my background is
          my involvement in competitive cheerleading. I am a three-time national
          champion with Weber State Cheerleading, which has not only provided me
          with a strong sense of discipline and teamwork but has also ignited my
          passion for performance and movement. This experience has given me a
          unique perspective on the importance of visual appeal and animation,
          which is one of the reasons I am excited to take this web animation
          class.

          <br /><br />
          I am enrolling in this web animation class because I believe it's a
          natural extension of my interests in art, design, and the visual
          aspects of performance. I want to learn how to use animation to
          enhance the user experience on websites, making them more engaging and
          interactive. Whether it's creating captivating transitions or bringing
          graphics to life, I am eager to explore the creative potential of web
          animation and apply it to my design projects.

          <br /><br />
          In terms of my experience with web technologies, I have a vast
          knowledge of adobe programs, in illustrator, photoshop and after
          effects. I have an intermediate level of knowledge in HTML and CSS.
          I've been learning web development for a while and have created basic
          websites. However, I'm eager to build my confidence and deepen my
          skills in web animation to make my web designs more dynamic and
          visually appealing. This class will provide me with the opportunity to
          refine my expertise in this area and merge my artistic interests with
          my technical knowledge.
